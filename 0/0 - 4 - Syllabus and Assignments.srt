1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:06,750
So let's talk briefly about the syllabus and
the assignments for the course. You can take

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:13,750
the course for the technology or for the philosophy,
which is of a highly applied variety, or both.

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,820
Here is the Stanford Bulletin description
for the previous offering of the course. It

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:24,009
gives a good outline of many of the things
in it. We're structuring it somewhat differently,

5
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:30,130
but I present this for completeness. Here's
our schedule. So we start on June 17 and we

6
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:37,130
go until August 25, so exactly ten weeks or
seventy days. And homeworks go out on Wednesdays,

7
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,260
and they're due at 11:59PM on the following
Wednesday. After this point over here, the

8
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,620
final project starts, and the final project
winners (this is just bragging rights with

9
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:53,620
no money involved) are declared on August
25th at 11:59PM PST. We'll talk about the

10
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,350
final projects in a little bit.

11
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,900
In terms of the syllabus, this is a technical
component. We're going to start you off signing

12
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,789
up for web services, and progressively build
out your development environment, teach you

13
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:13,369
some CSS, some basic responsive design, front-end
javascript, back-end javascript, and build

14
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:20,359
up a fairly sophisticated application by the
end of this. Complementing this technical

15
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:27,359
portion, we also have a philosophical portion.
These weeks are meant to go together. The

16
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:36,409
philosophy that we introduce somewhat relates
to the technology. For example, here we talk

17
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:42,060
about design and PR and so on in the same
week we're learning about design and CSS and

18
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,289
those kinds of things. Here we talk about
sales, marketing, and funnel; and here you're

19
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:52,579
going through some degree of analytics and
cost-of-customer acquisition and whatnot.

20
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,869
These are meant to complement each other.

21
00:01:55,869 --> 00:02:00,209
In terms of the assignments, there are graded
homeworks, which are the primary component

22
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:04,369
of your grade; they go out on Wednesdays;
standard multiple choice quizzes and programming

23
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:09,399
assignments in javascript. These are objective
answers that are autograded. As for the final

24
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:14,790
project, it is partially graded. You can see
the slides here for details. It is basically

25
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:20,510
a bitcoin powered self-starter, a crowd-funding
app that you will build up over the course

26
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:25,489
of the quarter and then fill it with your
own concept. What are graded are the technical

27
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:30,500
details of that application. What is not graded
is the qualitative content or the video, i.e.,

28
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,430
the product that you're building. That's not
graded. In typical what we're doing is we're

29
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:38,129
going to rank this on the base of the number
of bitcoins that you've raised and other kinds

30
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:42,110
of metrics that are hard to game, which we'll
talk about in a little bit.

31
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,120
As I've mentioned, the assignments are due
on Wednesdays. This is just a table that you

32
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,400
can consult to be totally definitive about
when things are going out and when they're

33
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,450
coming in. There are seven homeworks in total.
The first one is easy to allow a late start,

34
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,549
and the last one is short to allow project
focus. But the ones in the middle will be

35
00:02:58,549 --> 00:02:59,579
reasonably challenging.

00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:06,250
Welcome. This is the Startup Engineering course
on Coursera. My name is Balaji Srinivasan.

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:11,799
I'm going to be the primary instructor for
the course. We love to have you. This is the

3
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:15,299
first time that this course is being offered
as a MOOC. So, it's an experiment in many

4
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:20,460
ways. It's an ambitious course. Unlike a normal
course, I won't be able to speak to you in

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,730
real time after class, so I will look for
your comments on the forums, and will monitor

6
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:32,730
them closely. So, please do be active there.
So, OK, without further ado, let's get started.

7
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,320
So the title of the course is Startup Engineering.
This is just kind of the logistics slide.

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,010
I'm not going to read every little bit, but
this is the URL you signed up on, however

9
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:47,530
this is the primary class URL and this is
the forum URL, so make sure to bookmark this

10
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:54,070
one. In terms of you know kind of the motivation
behind the class, this is really the class

11
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:59,040
we wish we'd had before starting up our own
company, and in Vijay's case, his research

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,000
lab. It's a spiritual sequel to Peter Thiel's
CS 183, whereas that class was a hundred percent

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,740
philosophy, this class you can consider it
as fifty percent technology and fifty percent

14
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,100
philosophy. There's going to be multiple choice
and programming assignments like in the standard

15
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,830
class. There's also a final project. You're
going to be programming your own simple crowd

16
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:23,830
funding site and using it to market your own
startup idea. The final project will be partially

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,560
graded on the technical aspects of this crowd
funding site, but really you are going to

18
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,479
be doing for the public recognition, and for
the own satisfaction of building something.

19
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,799
You should go to forums, meetup and hackathons
over the course of the class, but it is an

20
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,490
individual class for the most part and you
should submit your own work. I'll have a comment

21
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:48,490
later in the slide on teams. Here are those
URLs again. This URL will be a convenience

22
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:53,890
URL. It will be updated later this week so
that you can kind of track the course materials

23
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:58,009
even when logged out. Importantly, with the
text book, all the notes are online. There's

24
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:04,280
nothing to buy. A task for help or report
bugs, please use the discussion forum rather

25
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,950
than email. There's a hundred thousand students,
so email will not scale.

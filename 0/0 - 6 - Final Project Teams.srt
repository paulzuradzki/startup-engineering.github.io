00:00:01,069 --> 00:00:03,379
Let's talk about collaboration and teams for
a little bit.

2
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:10,379
On the final project, can people work in teams?
I would prefer that you don't work in teams,

3
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:17,130
because it's kind of difficult and Coursera
isn't really set up for it. (Obviously in

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,189
real life, you're going to start a company
with a team, not as an individual, usually.)

5
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:26,689
But if you do want to work in teams, we can
try this as an experiment. The idea would

6
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:30,599
be that you would submit the graded portion
of each final project as individuals -- and

7
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,600
you can click this to see what I mean by the
"Graded portion," or the technical aspects

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,140
-- all of these you would submit your own
site, as an individual for technical grading,

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:47,140
while you'd leave the qualitative stuff all
rudimentary, in your own thing.

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,719
This way, if three people are working on the
same product as a team, all of them would

11
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,649
do the technical portions individually for
grading, but then, for the last three weeks

12
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:04,649
when it comes time to promote the project
in this portion of the class, you would switch

13
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,540
over and all three team members would work
together on promoting the product.

14
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:20,540
So that is the idea behind how teams would
work. For all non-final project individual

15
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,370
assignments, it goes without saying that you
should submit your answers as individuals.

00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:07,230
Great. So, I'd like to now briefly introduce
myself and the other members of the teaching

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:14,230
staff. So, brief introduction, so my name
is Balaji Srinivasan. You can call me BSS

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,890
or Balaji S. I am a Stanford lifer. I did
all my education there. I also taught computer

4
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:27,220
science and statistics there before founding
a startup. That startup is called Counsyl.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:33,720
It's been very successful. You can read these
links. Basically we scaled Counsyl from a

6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:39,810
Stanford dorm room to a huge sixty thousand
square foot clinical genome center with two

7
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:44,050
hundred employees, around three percent of
U.S. births, and along the way we raised more

8
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:50,040
than sixty five million dollars in funding,
and here's a few article clips on Counsyl

9
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:57,040
in the New York Times, you know, Tech Crunch,
the Wall Street Journal and Scientific American.

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:04,009
And that's kind of the summary for me. You
can kind of read over those articles and get

11
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:11,009
a sense of my background. The next instructor,
Vijay Pande, will be teaching some of the

12
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:17,630
lectures toward the end of the quarter, or
the course rather. Vijay has his own Wikipedia

13
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:23,040
article. He's the director of the Folding@Home
project and an expert in distributed computing.

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,670
Here's a couple of clips on that. You can
take a look at this at Wikipedia, and also

15
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:33,670
at the folding.stanford.edu site. Finally,
this is the T.A., Alex Chia. Alex is Stanford

16
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,939
as well, MS in computer science, Carnegie
Mellon undergrad. He's won many programming

17
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,630
competitions and Alex will also be very active
on the forums.

00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:06,810
So let's talk about the final project for
a bit. We refer to it in the previous slides,

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:12,260
but let's go into it in detail. The idea is
that you're going to build your own simple

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:18,169
Bitcoin-powered, crowdfunding site, featuring
your own product. The idea here is that when

4
00:00:18,169 --> 00:00:24,649
you've got 100,000 final projects, this presents
unique problems. You want to allow automatic

5
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:28,439
scoring and ranking, but also leave some room
for creativity. You want to enrich beginners,

6
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,939
but challenge advanced students. And you want
to complete it within a relatively short course

7
00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:35,960
period, yet simulate as much of the founding
process as possible.

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,470
And after a lot of deliberation, what we're
doing is combining selfstarter and Bitcoin

9
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:44,100
(you can read about them over here). What
you're going to be doing is, over the course

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,800
of the quarter, programming your own node.js
version of selfstarter and adding in social

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,140
sharing, Bitcoin, and your product. Graphically,
you can think of it as this is the official

12
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,380
selfstarter open-source project, and you're
making a personal version of this to teach

13
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:05,149
yourself some web-programming, but also to
teach yourself many other aspects of building

14
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:12,149
a startup, customizing things, marketing things,
and whatnot. The social sharing aspects are

15
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:19,859
relatively straightforward; the Bitcoin aspect
is pretty interesting. The concept is that

16
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:23,700
we're going to grade the technical aspects
of that final project, but not the qualitative

17
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,369
aspects. For example, we will grade the fact
that you've got your "Hello World" site up

18
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:32,950
successfully at a URL and you've deployed
it, but not the name of your domain. Or we

19
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:37,530
will, for example, grade the fact that you
have your social and payment integrations

20
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,719
up, but not the look and feel of those integrations.

21
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,840
At the very end, the ungraded part is the
number of social shares and the number of

22
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,130
Bitcoin that you've raised, but this is really
for your bragging rights. All these things

23
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,969
are in terms of quality are for bragging rights
and for the quality of the product if you

24
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:56,499
want to take the class very seriously.

25
00:01:56,499 --> 00:02:01,469
So, you choose the product, the text, the
video, design, and all the qualitative aspects

26
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:05,149
of the selfstarter. We can only autograde
the technical parts, but we allow your creativity

27
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:10,110
to shine through. The reason that we choose
Bitcoin in particular is that the class is

28
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:16,440
international and in that sense Bitcoin is
very good because you can do payments across

29
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,360
borders without transaction fees. Everyone
can get a merchant account setup within days;

30
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,460
they don't need to apply for banks. So for
a project that's teaching startups pedagogically,

31
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,130
that's extremely useful. But it's also very
good for this particular application because

32
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:35,720
Bitcoin transactions are world-readable. We
can see, for example, all the money that was

33
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:41,670
donated to this particular address by simply
going to a site like blockchain.info, and

34
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:47,350
see that this particular person at this address
received money at the following times and

35
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:51,240
in the following amounts, so we can see when
they started. So in this fashion, for example,

36
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,790
we can look at the Bitcoin address associated
with your project and see exactly how much

37
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:58,120
you've raised, and what time, and in what
quantities, and make sure that people are

38
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:05,120
not gaming the system. There will also be
a leaderboard. For example, example.com is

39
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,460
rated #1 in the genomics category. We're ranking
currently on the base of the number of Bitcoin

40
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,010
raised in their crowdfunder, but one could
also rank, for example, on the number of tweets

41
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:22,290
or Facebook shares involving example.com.
If we ranked by tweets, then example2.com

42
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:29,290
would actually rank #1, and it would also
be #1 in the law category. So let's talk by

43
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,970
categories for a second and prizes.

44
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,810
Oh, before we do that let's about some other
comments. We're going to review Bitcoin in

45
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,650
great detail later in the course, but you
can start by clicking these two links to go

46
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:46,430
and obtain some Bitcoin. But importantly,
buying Bitcoin is not needed to pass the course;

47
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:50,590
it's completely optional. The final project
is just meant to be hard to game. For those

48
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:56,630
who want to do something real, you can. Gaming
the process of getting a lot of money into

49
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:02,090
your Bitcoin account is a lot like running
a profitable company. For those who don't

50
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,900
want to do a real money crowdfunder, you can
maximize the number of Facebook or Twitter

51
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,430
shares instead.

52
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,770
Let's talk about prizes for a second. We're
going to have prizes in at least four categories.

53
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:18,810
After you fill out the survey, we'll likely
add more. You choose your category when you

54
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:23,230
enter the leaderboard, which will go live
later in class. As I've said, this is for

55
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:29,100
bragging rights only. What we'll do is rank
order and prizes in each category in each

56
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,870
class. To be counted as a winner, you would
have to be in one of the high positions on

57
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,630
the last day when the leaderboard is frozen
and the winners are announced. Remember again,

58
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,960
you don't need to participate in the public
leaderboard to get a 100% grade in the class,

59
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,810
and you don't need to use Bitcoin to compete
in the public competition. You can compete

60
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:52,440
solely on the number of social media shares.
But I like this as a concept because those

61
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,490
who want to take the class very seriously
can actually simulate a lot the process of

62
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,100
starting a company, raising money, and building
the tech for the product.

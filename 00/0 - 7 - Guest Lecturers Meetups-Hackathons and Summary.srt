1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,889
Lets talk community and collaboration and
then summarize.

2
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:10,519
In terms of community and collaboration, we're
going to have many important guest lecturers

3
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:13,829
(which we are going to upload as the class
progresses) from many of the top startups

4
00:00:13,829 --> 00:00:16,630
and big companies in Silicon Valley.

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:21,439
Forums, meet ups, and hackathons will be an
important part of the class. Please use the

6
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,000
discussion forums if you have questions, as
we will monitor them closely. As for meetups

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,880
and hackathons, read this forum thread, find
class meet ups in your city, create a thread

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,910
with your city if it doesn't exist (for example,
here's a New York forum thread meetup) and

9
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,340
if you live in a very remote area, use this
thread instead of Google hangouts with fellow

10
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,990
classmates.

11
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,760
Take pictures of meetups and link them from
the forum. The distinction here--and maybe

12
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,100
it's not that material--is you organize meetups
to go over the course material whereas hackathons

13
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:54,050
are really just about cranking on code. But
maybe those are the same thing, in your view.

14
00:00:54,050 --> 00:01:01,050
In terms of the summary, then, the class basically
covers everything we wish we knew before starting

15
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,240
our companies or labs. There's going to be
a lot of Javascript and web programming. The

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,430
final project is building your own Bitcoin-powered
crowdfunder over the quarter and then using

17
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,210
it to market your own product.

18
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,000
Please go over these links to figure out what
to do next. Perhaps the most important bit

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,940
is to share the course signup link with any
friends that might be interested. After that,

20
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,620
you can continue here the next lecture in
Week 1. As for Homework 1, it will be out

21
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,909
Wednesday, and will be due on June 26th.

22
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:32,510
Welcome to the class. We're glad to have you!
